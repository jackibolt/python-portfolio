Title: Python Portfolie

This app is a demonstration of, and portfolio of, my python development. 

To run this project locally, download the project files from github(where you are currently accessing it). Open the files in an IDE of your choosing. Create a virtual environment, install requirements by running 'pip3 install -r requirements.txt' in the command line. From inside the main directory, run app.py. 

In making this portfolio site, and throughout my Python techdegree, I learned to generate interactive webapps built on Python, using Flask and SQL. In my previous development experience I've used python to parse/create JSON data, so learning more about SQL was super informative, and opens a variety of possibilities for future projects.
